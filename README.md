# RockSat-X
- Software components and modules for the RockSat-X payload - Modular system based around decks designed for suborbital flights with  NASA Wallops Flight Facilityâ€™s (WFF)

- Based off of a Ballistic Acquisition Telemetry and Trajectory System using an Arduino to report telemetry from a self-contained device to a fixed ground station.

- The RockSat-X Program is a standardized approach that provides customers low cost access to space. RockSat-X has an ejectable skin and nose cone that will expose experiments to the space environment fully at an apogee of 150-170 km. Additionally, the rocket will be de-spun and stabilized to allow for a greater range of experiments and utilization of microgravity. Other highlights include Wallops provided power and telemetry. By providing these amenities, experimenters can spend more time on payload design and less on power and data storage systems. The current design also provides an opportunity for the Attitude Control System (ACS) to align the rocket parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field.

- Development through CoC and CSUN IEEE collaboration.
